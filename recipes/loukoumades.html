    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried Greek honey puffs.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl. 
            The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). 
            Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. 
            In a large bowl, mix the warm milk, sugar, and salt, and mix to dissolve. 
            Pour the yeast mixture into the milk mixture, and stir to combine</li>
        <li>Beat in the butter, eggs, and flour until the mixture forms a smooth, soft dough. 
            Cover the bowl, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. 
            Stir the dough well, cover, and let rise 30 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix honey and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
            Turn off the heat and let the honey syrup cool.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Oil should be about 2 inches deep.</li>
        <li>Place a large table or soup spoon in a glass of water near the batter. 
            Scoop up about 2 tablespoons of dough per puff with the wet spoon, 
            drop it into the wet palm of your hand, and roll it back into the spoon to create a round shape. 
            Do not overhandle the puffy, soft dough. Drop the dough balls into the hot oil in batches, 
            wetting the spoon each time you make a dough ball. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown 
            on the bottom, and roll them over to cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. 
            Gently set the loukoumades aside to drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Place the loukoumades on a baking sheet, drizzle them with honey syrup, 
            and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm.</li>
