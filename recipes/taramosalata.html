    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Taramosalata is a classic Greek appetizer made with soaked bread, fish roe,
         olive oil, and lemon juice. Satisfyingly delicious, it's perfect served 
         on pita bread as part of a meze platter or a tasty lunch with some olives 
         and a salad on the side.</p>
    <p>Tarama is the cured roe of either carp, cod or mullet. It is available 
        as either white or pink roe, and either are fine to use, though white 
        is more desirable.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>13 ounces bread, crust removed</li>
        <li>cold water to cover</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 large lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 cup tarama (cured carp, cod, or mullet roe)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bread in a bowl, cover with water and let sit until the bread 
            is well soaked, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain water from the bowl and squeeze 
            all of the excess water from the bread.</li>
        <li>Combine bread, olive oil, onion, and lemon juice in a food processor; process 
            until smooth. Add tarama and process until well combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Bonus Tips</h4>
    <p>When finished blending ingredients, taste and adjust if necessary — 
        add more lemon juice if too bitter, more tarama if you like a stronger flavor, 
        or more olive oil if a richer texture is desired.</p>
        <p>For a modern twist on this classic recipe, I like to first caramelize the onions 
            in some olive oil with a pinch of chili flakes before adding to the food processor.</p>
